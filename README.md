# SildeQtUtils
Some classes and GUI controls comon on my QT projects

If any of my projects doesn't compile due a missing header, it should be here.

Clone this repository in the same directory where are the projects, and all wil compile fine.
Meaning: you'll need a structure like this:

```
<YourProjectDir> -> SildeQtUtils
                 -> QMikPPPManager
                 -> BasicSNMP
                 -> <other>
```
